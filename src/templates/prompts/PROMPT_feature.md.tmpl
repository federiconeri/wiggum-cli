## Context
Study @.ralph/AGENTS.md for commands and patterns.
Study @.ralph/specs/README.md for spec structure.
Study @.ralph/specs/$FEATURE.md for feature specification.
{{#if frameworkVariant}}For detailed architecture, see @{{appDir}}/.claude/CLAUDE.md{{/if}}

## Search
- Use `mgrep "query"` to analyze existing codebase patterns
- Use Context7 MCP to lookup library APIs and best practices

## Phase: Planning
1. Read the spec file: @.ralph/specs/$FEATURE.md
2. Analyze codebase to identify what exists vs what's needed
3. Create @.ralph/specs/$FEATURE-implementation-plan.md with tasks

## Implementation Plan Format
```markdown
# $FEATURE Implementation Plan

**Spec:** .ralph/specs/$FEATURE.md
**Branch:** feat/$FEATURE
**Status:** Planning | In Progress | PR Review | Completed

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Task 1 - [complexity: S/M/L]
- [ ] Task 2

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Task 4

### Phase 3: Tests (Unit/Integration)
- [ ] Write tests for [component]
- [ ] Write tests for [feature]

### Phase 4: Polish & Design
- [ ] Run design checklist from @.ralph/guides/FRONTEND.md (if UI changes)
- [ ] Verify responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- [ ] Add loading/empty/error states
- [ ] Verify hover/focus states on interactive elements
{{#if styling}}- [ ] For charts: use ChartContainer pattern with tooltips + legends{{/if}}
- [ ] Task N (additional polish)

### Phase 5: E2E Testing
Browser-based tests executed via Playwright MCP tools.

- [ ] E2E: [Scenario name] - [brief description]
  - **URL:** [starting URL, use {placeholders} for dynamic IDs]
  - **Preconditions:** [setup requirements, e.g., "Survey must be published"]
  - **Steps:**
    1. [Action] -> [expected result]
    2. [Action] -> [expected result]
  - **Verify:** [final assertion text to check]
  - **Database check:** [optional SQL query to verify data]

Example E2E scenario:
- [ ] E2E: Submit survey response - happy path
  - **URL:** /survey/{surveyId}?utm_source=e2e_test
  - **Preconditions:** Published survey with required questions
  - **Steps:**
    1. Navigate to survey URL -> Form displays with all questions
    2. Fill required text field -> No validation error
    3. Select rating 4 -> Button shows selected state
    4. Click "Submit Survey" -> Loading state appears
    5. Wait for "Thank You!" -> Success card displays
  - **Verify:** "successfully submitted" text visible
  - **Database check:** SELECT * FROM survey_responses WHERE survey_id = '{surveyId}'

## Done
- [x] Completed task - [commit hash]
- [x] E2E: Scenario name - PASSED
```

## Rules
- Plan only in this phase, do NOT implement
- One task = one commit-sized unit of work
- Every implementation task needs a corresponding test task
- Use Supabase MCP to check existing schema
- Use PostHog MCP to check existing analytics setup
- For UI-heavy features (new pages, dashboards, analytics, marketing pages), reference @.ralph/guides/FRONTEND.md
- Consider `/frontend-design` skill for features needing distinctive aesthetics
