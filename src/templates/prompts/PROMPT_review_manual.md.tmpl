## Context
Study @.ralph/AGENTS.md for commands and patterns.
Study @.ralph/specs/$FEATURE.md for feature specification.
Study @.ralph/specs/$FEATURE-implementation-plan.md for completed tasks.

## Learnings
Read @.ralph/LEARNINGS.md for patterns from previous features.
Capture any review feedback patterns for future iterations.

## Task
All implementation and E2E tasks are complete. Create PR for manual review.

### Step 1: Verify Ready State
1. Check all tasks are complete in implementation plan (no `- [ ]` items)
2. Verify tests pass: `cd {{appDir}} && {{testCommand}}`
3. Verify build succeeds: `cd {{appDir}} && {{buildCommand}}`

If any fail, fix before proceeding.

### Step 2: Check Git Status
```bash
cd {{appDir}} && git status
cd {{appDir}} && git log --oneline -5
```

Ensure:
- On branch `feat/$FEATURE`
- All changes are committed
- Branch is pushed to remote

If uncommitted changes exist:
```bash
git -C {{appDir}} add -A && git -C {{appDir}} commit -m "chore($FEATURE): final cleanup"
git -C {{appDir}} push origin feat/$FEATURE
```

### Step 3: Create PR
Check if PR already exists:
```bash
cd {{appDir}} && gh pr list --head feat/$FEATURE
```

If no PR exists, create one:
```bash
cd {{appDir}} && gh pr create --base main --head feat/$FEATURE \
  --title "feat($FEATURE): [read description from spec]" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
[Read from spec Purpose section]

## Changes
[Read from implementation plan - list completed phases]

## Testing
- [x] Unit/integration tests: passing
- [x] E2E tests: All scenarios passed
- [x] Build succeeds

## E2E Test Results
[Copy from implementation plan if E2E phase exists]

### Manual Review Required

**PR created. Review and merge manually.**

The feature branch has been prepared and pushed. A pull request has been created for human review.

**Next steps (manual):**
1. Review the PR on GitHub
2. Address any review comments
3. Merge when approved

Note: Spec status updates are handled in the Spec Verification phase before PR creation.

## Rules
- Manual review mode stops after PR creation
- No automated code review or merge
- Human review and approval required before merging
- If gh CLI fails, check authentication: `gh auth status`

## Troubleshooting
- **gh: command not found** -> Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh`
- **gh auth error** -> Run: `gh auth login`
- **PR already exists** -> Use: `gh pr view` to see status

## Learning Capture
If you discover patterns worth remembering during PR creation, append to @.ralph/LEARNINGS.md:
- Process improvements -> Add under "## Tool Usage"
- Common issues -> Add under "## Anti-Patterns"

Format: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] [$FEATURE] Brief description`
