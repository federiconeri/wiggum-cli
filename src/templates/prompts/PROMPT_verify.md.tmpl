## Context
Study @.ralph/specs/$FEATURE.md for original specification.
Study @.ralph/specs/$FEATURE-implementation-plan.md for completed tasks.

## Learnings
Read @.ralph/LEARNINGS.md for verification patterns from previous features.

## Task
Verify that the implementation meets the spec requirements. Update spec files accordingly.

### Step 1: Review Requirements
Read @.ralph/specs/$FEATURE.md and for each requirement under "## Requirements":
- Check if it was implemented (review implementation plan tasks)
- Mark as `[x]` if complete
- Leave as `[ ]` if not implemented, add note explaining why

### Step 2: Review Acceptance Criteria
For each item under "## Acceptance Criteria":
- Verify against E2E test results in implementation plan
- Mark as `[x]` if verified
- Leave as `[ ]` with note if not met

### Step 3: Update Spec Status
Change `**Status:** Planned` (or `Draft`) to:
- `**Status:** Completed` if all requirements met
- `**Status:** Partial` if some requirements not met (with notes)

Update `**Last Updated:**` to today's date.

### Step 4: Update README.md
Update @.ralph/specs/README.md Active Specs table:
- Change status from "Planned" to "Completed" (or "Partial")
- Update Last Updated date

### Step 5: Document Gaps (if any)
If any requirements were not fully met, add a section to the spec:

```markdown
## Implementation Notes
- [Requirement X] - Deferred: [reason]
- [Acceptance Criteria Y] - Partial: [explanation]
```

### Step 6: Commit Changes
```bash
git -C {{appDir}} add ../.ralph/specs/
git -C {{appDir}} commit -m "docs($FEATURE): verify spec requirements complete"
git -C {{appDir}} push origin feat/$FEATURE
```

## Verification Checklist
Before marking complete, ensure:
- [ ] All requirements in spec have been reviewed
- [ ] All acceptance criteria have been reviewed
- [ ] Spec status updated appropriately
- [ ] README.md table updated
- [ ] Any gaps documented with clear explanations
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed

## Rules
- Be thorough - check every requirement and acceptance criterion
- Be honest - don't mark incomplete items as complete
- Document gaps clearly for future reference
- If a requirement was intentionally deferred, explain why

## Learning Capture
If verification revealed patterns worth remembering, append to @.ralph/LEARNINGS.md:
- Common gaps between spec and implementation -> Add under "## Anti-Patterns"
- Useful spec writing patterns -> Add under "## Patterns"
- Verification tips -> Add under "## Tool Usage"
